## Installation

In order to use the README Generator, the user must clone the repository from GitHub (https://github.com/LisaLReynolds/readme-generator) to their local terminal. Navigate into the project directory and install the required dependencies by running: npm install. Then to run the application enter: node index.js

## Usage

Once the repository has been cloned and inquirer has been installed, run the application by entering in the terminal: node index.js. Then answer each question to provide the content of the README. When all the questions have been answered, there will be a message that reads "Your file was created successfully!" and the README.md file will be available in the "Explorer" view in VS Code.
